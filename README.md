# FourFit: Fitting the Fourier Series with Confidence

Welcome to FourFit, a project that explores the capabilities and limitations of OpenAI's GPT-3.5 language model to write academic research software, documentation, and reports. **With FourFit, you'll never have to forfeit your confidence in Fourier series fitting again!**

This software is designed to help researchers and data analysts fit noisy data to the Fourier series and estimate the quality of the fit with confidence. All code and documentation in this project have been written by OpenAI's ChatGPT, a powerful AI language model that can assist with many aspects of the software development process.

## Program Overview

The FourFit program uses the lsqnonlin function from the optim package in Octave/MATLAB to fit a Fourier series to noisy data. The program allows the user to specify the number of terms in the Fourier series and the range of the input data. The program then generates noisy data using the specified input range and fits a Fourier series to the data using lsqnonlin. The program outputs the fitted Fourier coefficients, the R-squared value for the fit, the standard error and confidence intervals for each coefficient, and the p-value for the fit.

## Getting Started

To get started with the FourFit program, you will need to have Octave or MATLAB installed on your computer. Once you have installed Octave/MATLAB, you can download the FourFit code from this GitHub repository.

## Usage

To use the FourFit program, simply run the FourFit.m script in Octave/MATLAB. You can adjust the number of Fourier terms and the range of the input data by modifying the variables n_terms, x_min, and x_max in the script.
